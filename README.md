# CivicPulse
CivicPulse is a crowd sourced civic issue reporting web app that lets use to report the issues nearby like potholes, broken electrical poles, overflowing sewer etc. It uses leaflet Js to send the co-ordinates of the location where issue was reported. It uses JWT for authentication, mongoDB for schemas and  models, cloudinary for image uploads.
